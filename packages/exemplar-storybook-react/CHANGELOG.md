# CHANGELOG

### 1.1.1

- Add missing `dependencies`.

### 1.1.0

  as as backwards compatible. It is trivial since the backwards
  compatibility is preset is simply a `presets.js` 
  file requiring `./index.js`.

- Rename from `@exemplar/storybook-react` for clarity around purpose & scope.

### @exemplar/storybook@2.0.0

- Update to `storybook/react@5`

### @exemplar/storybook@1.0.0
